You need to have a MySQL database running and NodeJS installed.

Inside the `src` folder various scripts are available:
* `api.js` to start the web server with API
* `migrate-database.js` to setup the database tables
* `prepare-season.js` to fill the database with bot teams and games to play
* `play-game-day.js` calculate the results for the next game day

A UI is implemented. When you run the API, you can open the UI on http://localhost:3000
